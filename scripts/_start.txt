Eheheh, thank you for trying out this visual novel engine
@Yama_Uba

Well, it ain't quite an engine, more a webpage template with a lightweight sprinkling of javascript
We can display all the usual html formatting... <br> <b>enboldened</b>, <i>crooked</i>, <u>underlined</u>, <big>expanded</big>, <small>squashed</small>, <mark>highlighted</mark>, <del>removed</del>, <sup>superscript</sup>
Here, anything you can shove in a website can go in line of dialouge

Anything?..
@Yama_Uba
Anything that can go in a website
@Baba_Yaga
We can even pull javascript directy from the script, Let us display the debug box...
¬debugbox.style.display = "block";
Here you can see what the code outputs..
We can hide it again now.
¬debugbox.style.display = "none";
I'll go check on the laundry

see you later sweetie
